## Features
* Create a screenshot using `I save screenshot` or `save screenshot` step definition.
* Create a screenshot when test fails.
* Screenshot is saved as HTML page for Goutte driver.
* Screenshot is saved as both HTML and PNG image for Selenium driver.
* Screenshot directory can be specified through environment variable `BEHAT_SCREENSHOT_DIR` (useful for CI systems to override values in `behat.yml`).
* Screenshots can be purged after every test run by setting `purge: true` (useful during test debugging). 

## Installation
`composer require integratedexperts/behat-screenshot`

## Usage
Example `behat.yml`:
```yaml
default:
  suites:
    default:
      contexts:
        - IntegratedExperts\BehatScreenshotExtension\Context\ScreenshotContext
        - FeatureContext
  extensions:
    IntegratedExperts\BehatScreenshotExtension:
      dir: '%paths.base%/screenshots'
      fail: true
      purge: false
```

In your feature:
```
  Given I am on "http://google.com"  
  Then I save screenshot
```

You may optionally specify size of browser window in the screenshot step:

```
  Then I save 1440 x 900 screenshot
  And I save 800 x 600 screenshot
```

## Options

- `dir:` `path/to/dir`

  Path to directory to save screenshots. Directory structure will be created if the directory does not exist.
  
- `fail:` `true` or `false` (default `false`)
  
  Prefix failed screenshots with 'fail_' string. Useful to distinguish failed and intended screenshots.
      
- `purge:` `true` or `false` (default `false`)
  
  Remove all files from the screenshots directory on each test run. Useful during debugging of tests.
